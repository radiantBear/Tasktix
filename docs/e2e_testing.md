# End to End Testing

We are using Cypress to support end-to-end tests that interact with this project as
similarly to end users as possible. Here are some helpful links for getting started with
Cypress:

- [Best practices](https://docs.cypress.io/app/core-concepts/best-practices)
- [Example app](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app)
- [Cross-browser testing](https://docs.cypress.io/app/guides/cross-browser-testing)
- [Visual regression testing](https://docs.cypress.io/app/tooling/visual-testing)
- [Tasks, e.g. database seeding](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/task#Seed-a-database)
  - [Similarly, exec for system commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/exec)
- [Writing commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands)
- [Continuous integration](https://docs.cypress.io/app/continuous-integration/overview)
