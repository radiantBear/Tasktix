# Website Design Decisions

## Middleware Not Used For Authorization

A `middleware.ts` file is [the usual way](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/authentication#protecting-routes-with-middleware) to handle authorization for protected pages. However, the MySQL library requires the 'net' module, which the edge runtime that runs `middleware.ts` does not support. This means it is impossible to verify that the user's session cookie is valid via middleware.

Instead, each protected page **must** begin by verifying that the user is authorized or redirect them to `/signIn`. This can be accomplished by starting the React component (for the page _or_ layout) for the page with `await authorize();`.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is **crucial** that you `await` the response of `authorize()` to prevent loading the page before `authorize()` has determined that it is safe to do so.

This has the benefit of operating in more consistently with API endpoints, which can not use `middleware.ts` for authorization anyway.

## API Over Server Actions

This project uses a REST API for communicating with the server instead of the Server Actions built into Next.js. There are a handful of reasons for this; mainly:

- Server Actions could not be used if a mobile app is developed, and an API would need to be developed anyway;
- Next.js' Server Actions structure provides little control over when database sessions are created and destroyed;
- Server Actions provide little granularity for responses (just `throw`ing or `return`ing); and
- REST APIs are well-regarded for their maintainability.

There are some drawbacks of this decision, however:

- Server Actions guarantee type safety since they're just function calls, but API calls do not;
- Server Actions automatically take care of many details that APIs must explicitly define; and
- This approach does not take advantage of all Next.js features.

This decision may be revisited in the future, but a change to Server Actions is unlikely.
